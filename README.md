# NICS-Census
Exploratory data analysis combining two datasets, US Census and NICS data.

In this project I explore two datasets and draw infrences from them. I also use basic statistics to support my conclusions. This is accompanied with markdown cells explaining my code. 

Note:
The NICS dataset used in this project was derived from the FBI's annual National Instant Check System report. 
The US Census dataset is a subset of the entire census report for the year 2016.
